# Assessing-exposure-and-vulnerability-of-camping-sites-to-SWF-hazards-for-an-impact-based-EWS
Determining the exposure and vulnerability of camping sites to surface water floods plays an important role in developing flood impact forecast models and impact-based early warning systems. Data on exposure and vulnerability of camping sites can be combined with weather and hazard forecasts for forecasting the impacts on camping sites, whether days or hours before a surface water flood event might occur. The aim is to warn camping site managers in advance against surface water floods based on the specific site characteristics and location-based warning thresholds. We analyzed camping site data and geodata to investigate the exposure of camping sites in Switzerland to surface water floods. 26% of camping sites have a share of 40 to 100% of their total area exposed to surface water floods. By simulating different floodplain scenarios with the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model and using synthetic rainfall data, we determine the amount and duration of rainfall that leads to impacts for each camping site. Furthermore, to develop a comprehensive study, we will conduct interviews with a group of stakeholders, including insurance companies, cantonal and governmental agencies, as well as individuals working at camping sites to develop a vulnerability function for camping sites. Advancing our research in understanding the vulnerability of camping sites will mark a significant step forward in impact modelling and will serve as a valuable resource for other researchers, practitioners, and agencies dedicated to providing impact warnings.
